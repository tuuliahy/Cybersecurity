- I started the phase 4 task and I actually got it already done. This phase was so much easier than the previous ones because the code and the functionality of this booking system is already very familiar.
- I used the code that was given in the phase 3 and added the required things to that code because I wanted to challenge myself a bit (and not use the given code).
- I made also now the functional test for the whole booking system (everything is still working as it should work) and I also made the new Zap test for the account page. 
- **Here is link to the Master branch where is found the code that I updated and used in this phase: https://github.com/tuuliahy/Cybersecurity/tree/master**
- **Here is link to the Zap report where I tested the account page: https://github.com/tuuliahy/Cybersecurity/blob/main/2024-12-03-ZAP-ReportPhase4-.md**
- I answered the questions straight to the ItsLearning so the answers are found there.
